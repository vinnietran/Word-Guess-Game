# Word-Guess-Game

This project is used to play a simple game of "Hangman"

To begin simply press the key that you want to be your first guess

If your guess is correct you will see it display under "Current word"

If your guess is incorrect then you will see it displayed under "Already Guessed"

Note: Once you have exhausted all of your guesses, the game will end. 

Upon completion of the game (winning or losing) the next game will automatically load
